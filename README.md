# RMTFS
Remote File System

## Using it
First, my english is bad af.

1. Start RMTFS Viewer, put the prefered port (localhost and ':' sign must not change, it will explode. KABOOM) and then click on the Connect button. This will start the server, so Client can connect to it.
2. In another computer (the one you want to expore) start RMTFS Client with parameters. "-ServerIP=localhost" and "-ServerPort=15243" (by default).
3. Enjoy!. RMTFS Viewer will start to show the another's computer file explorer, and u can do a click double click folders, navigate, etc. By right click you can get files or folders.

## Yeah.
That it. Is amazing to use with [Borocito](https://github.com/Zhenboro/Borocito).
